Code I'm sharing with DSalle so updates are easier


TDV To Do
=========

 * Get figures lined up (may need to be after we do per-player-id)
 
 * Disentangle backbuffer rendering of color in colorstream
 * Then implement Z order
 * Then restrict to hands and head
 
 * keep old frames for most-recent-valid-point
 * keep old joint frames for secondary animation
 
 * Add abstraction for bone textures
 
 * Controller
 * integrate controller with main code
 
* Final birthday party art
* Final boyscout art

* Add interactive components to scene
* Make them use RT physics?
* Add confetti effect
